## Build a Bookmarks App

### Project Overview
Using everything you've learned over the Fundamentals section of the course, you will build the frontend for an API-powered Bookmarks application that lets the user store and rate their custom web bookmarks.

### Due Date and Grading
You have until the end of day Friday (typically 6PM ET) to complete your project and submit it for evaluation. To receive a passing grade, the project must:

* Fulfill every non-extension user story below
* Fulfill every non-extension technical requirement below

For successful submission, you *MUST*:

1) Push your final version to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo. Your repo should be inside the cohort's organization and named `[yourname]-bookmarks-app`.
2) Submit the project URL on the [Goals page of your Dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/goals) using the section titled "Submit API Hack Capstone". 

### User Stories

As a user:
* I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  * title
  * url link
  * description
  * rating (1-5)

* I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
  * All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

* I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
  * Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

* I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

* I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
  * Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. `title` and `url` field required)

* I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

* (Extension) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list

### Technical Requirements

* Use jQuery for AJAX and DOM manipulation

* Use namespacing to adhere to good architecture practices
  * Minimal global variables!
  * Create modules in separate files to organize your code
  * Logically group your functions (e.g. API methods, store methods...)

* Keep your Data out of the DOM
  * No direct DOM manipulation in your event handlers!
  * Follow the React-ful design pattern - change your state, re-render your component

* Use semantic HTML

* Use [responsive design](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-001v1/lesson/1.6)
  * Visually and functionally solid in viewports for mobile and desktop

* Follow a11y best practices
  * Refer back to the lessons on [accessibility](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-001v1/assignment/1.2.5), [forms](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-001v1/assignment/1.5.1)
  
* (Extension) Follow AJAX and a11y best practices
  * [AJAX and Aria Live](https://courses.thinkful.com/web-dev-002v1/assignment/1.2.3) for help


### Process

1) Before coding anything, think about your user flow. What does the initial loaded page look like?  What is each action a user can take and how does it affect the visual layout?

2) Draw up [gray box wireframes](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/html-wireframes/) using [MockFlow](http://mockflow.com), a free wireframing tool of your choice, or on a napkin!

3) For every wireframed application state, include a populated `store` object as an example next to it

4) Set up your project.  Create your Git repo, build your boilerplate file structure, connect jQuery and confirm your linked JavaScript/CSS files are being read by your HTML.

5) Build an HTML version of all the different states of your application. Use multiple HTML files if you wish - these will be deleted later, but useful for establishing the HTML strings your template generator functions will need to build.

6) Review the [API Documention](https://thinkful-list-api.herokuapp.com/endpoints/bookmarks). Perform some test requests with [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en). 

7) Construct your modules and **test every new function** as you build it.
